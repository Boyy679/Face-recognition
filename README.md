# Face Recognition

This project mainly has five sections to do face recognition:

* Section1: Face Feature Extraction
* Section2: Image Face Detection
* Section3: Web Camera Face Detection
* Section4: Video Face Classify
* Section5: Video Face detection

### Section1ï¼šFace Feature Extraction

This part shows the basic face recognition principles, including facial features and Facial embedding.

> **Facial features:** 

The basic idea in facial recognition in a regular face is to come up with 68 specific points(landmarks), including the chin, left eyebrow, right eyebrow, nose bridge, nose tip, left eye, right eye, top lip, and bottom lip.

We use the bidden face as an example to finish this job. This face will look like the following picture after face of the feature extract.

> **Facial Embedding:** 

This part will store each person's face information as a vector.

- Compare two face distance
  - Faces with a distance of **0.6 or less** should be a match.
  - Using a **0.55 cutoff** (if you want to be more strict; the cutoff would reduce false positive matches at the risk of more false negatives)

For example, we calculate the distance between Biden, Trump, and, Obama(by using *TSNE*):

### Section2: Image Face Detection

This section uses KNN and SVM classifiers to do face recognition.

* KNN model:
  * KNN classifier is first trained on labeled (known) faces. It can then predict the person in an unknown image by finding the k most similar faces (images with closet face features under ***Euclidean distance***) in its training set and performing a majority ***vote*** (possibly weighted) on their label. This implementation uses a *weighted vote*, so closer neighbors' votes are weighted more heavily. 
  * **Example:** if k=3, and the five closest face images to the given image in the training set are three images of Biden and two images of Obama, The result would be 'Biden.'
  * How to use:
    * Organize the set of images of the people you want to recognize in a single directory with a sub-directory for each known person.
    * Then, call the 'train' function with the appropriate parameters. Make sure to pass in the '*model_save_path*' if you want to save the model to disk so you can re-use the model without having to re-train it.
    * Call '*predict*' and pass in your trained model to recognize the people in an unknown image.

```
Directory tree:
1. train_dir/Biden/xxx.jpg ...
2. train_dir/Barack Obama/yyy.jpg ...
3. train_dir/Donald Trump/zzz.jpg ...
```

> **3D PCA**

Put Obama, Biden, Trump, Gates, Zuckerberg, and Pages' images visualized by 3D PCA

> Face detection

<div align=center><img src="b-image-face-detection\data\detectedimage.png" alt="detectedimage" width="35%" height="35%" /></div>

This is an example of recognizing Obama's face.

### Section3: Web Camera Face Detection

We ALSO can use a PC camera to achieve face detection.

You need to upload one image of the face you want to recognize and rename the image's name as the people's name.

```Directory tree:
Tree
1. data/Biden.jpg 
		Barack Obama.jpg
		Donald Trump.jpg
		... ...
```

When you run the code, the PC camera will open, and if you don't input some face images you want to detect into the data dictionary, it will detect as **unknown**, like the following.

<div align=center><img src="c-webcamera-face-detection\note\unknown.png" alt="unknown" width="35%" height="35%" /></div>

### Section4: Video Face Classify

We input a test video for the program and used T-SNE transform to do a face classification.

Then, we see the face encoding distribution in this video:

<div align=center><img src="d-video-face-classify\data\plot.png" alt="plot" width="40%" height="40%" /></div>

Because this test video mainly has two people, we can see 2 point clusters.

### Section5: Video Face Detection

This video face detect code can be used to label the faces in the video and output. 

This project uses the *Little Sheldon* video clip to do this part; the dataset is like the following tree:

```
Tree
Dataset/George
			01.jpg
			02.jpg
			...
		Georgie
			01.jpg
			02.jpg
			...
		Librarian
			01.jpg
			02.jpg
			...
		Little Shelton
			01.jpg
			02.jpg
			...
		... ...
```

The output of the next one left is the input, and the right is the output result:

And the face detection for *little Shelton*

<div align=center><img src="e-video-face-detection\data\image-20230420233655343.png" alt="image-20230420233655343"  /></div>
